# 1. Fetch News (Simplified for the script, agent will generate content usually)
# In a real cron, we might use a tool or fetch here. 
# For this setup, I'll provide the script structure.

# 2. Prepare Content (The agent will fill this in when triggered or the script will call an agent API)
# For the one-shot run now, I'll use the news gathered in session.

echo "Starting WordPress post for Nomad News..."

# Content will be passed via environment or generated here.
# For the immediate run, I'll perform a test post.
